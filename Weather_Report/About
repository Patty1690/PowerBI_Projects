# Weather API Dashboard
## Overview
This project is a Power BI presentation that visualizes real-time and historical weather data fetched from an external Weather API. The dashboard provides users with insights into temperature patterns, precipitation trends, and other key meteorological indicators.

## Features
Real-Time Weather Data – Displays current conditions for selected locations.

Historical Trends – Compare past weather data to identify seasonal patterns.

Geospatial Mapping – Weather conditions plotted on interactive maps.

Parameter Filtering – Filter by city, date, or weather metric (temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.).

API Integration – Automated data refresh from Weather API endpoints.

## Data Sources
Public or commercial Weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, AccuWeather).

Local CSV or database backups for historical comparisons.

## Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Power BI for visualization.

API Query Integration via Power Query or custom scripts.

DAX for calculated measures and KPIs.

JSON data parsing from API responses.

## Usage
Connect Power BI to the Weather API endpoint using your API key.

Refresh the dataset to pull the latest weather data.

Use filters to view specific regions or weather parameters.

Follow the story sequence in the presentation for a guided analysis.
